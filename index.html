            <h1>What is the difference between <code>switch</code> and
            <code>if/else</code>? When would you use one versus the other?</h1>
            <p>A switch statement is a way of comparing values. It is indicated
            by <code>switch() case [value]:</code>. No variables can be
            declared within a switch statement. By doing this, the computer
            compares the value of the case compared to the other items in a
            list. Switch is used when you have a finite list of correct
            answers, like months. If you have an input that's a month you write
            a switch and each month would be a case. "If/else" is a more
            commonly used comparison method for more open-ended cases. The "if"
            statement defines the condition using a Boolean statement and
            indicates what the program should do if those have been met. If
            those have not been met exactly, the "else" statement and action
            will run. <code>Else</code> can only be used immediately after an
            <code>if</code> statement.</p>
            <h1>What is "void" in a method declaration? How does this differ
            from declaring a method with a return type?</h1>
            <p>A method must be called in order to be used -- <code>void</code>
            means no value will be returned, and a statement means a value will
            be returned. The syntax of a method is:</p>
            <pre>
public static int methodName(int a, int b) {
    // body
}
            	</pre>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>public static = modifier</li>
        <li>int = return type</li>
        <li>methodName = name of the method</li>
        <li>a, b = formal parameters</li>
        <li>int a, int b = list of parameters</li>
    </ul>
    <p>"Void" means that any data type can be declared, such as int, String,
    boolean, or double. If parameters are declared, it means the program needs
    that information to produce the desired output. Parameters can be passed to
    a void method. The difference is that a void method can do an operation on
    something that is in memory. Something with a return value can be passed to
    another method directly without using a class variable.</p>
    <h1>What happens when you include <code>import java.util.Scanner;</code> in
    your code? Where does this functionality come from? What is the "java" in
    <code>java.util.Scanner;</code>?</h1>
    <p><code>import java.util.Scanner</code> means that we are importing the
    input library "Scanner". The functionality comes from creating and defining
    the scanner object, which has been "keyboard" because it is the method by
    which the human is transferring the answer into the computer's digital
    library. When you instantiate a Scanner you get access to all its methods,
    which include reading a file or harvesting user input. The import turns
    into a String. "Java" in the statement <code>import
    java.util.Scanner</code> is part of the naming convention and indicates
    that it is part of Java.</p>
    <h1>What does it mean to "cast a double to an int"? Give an example of when
    you would do this and explain what is happening.</h1>
    <p>Casting a double to an int means changing the value type from a decimal
    to an integer. Math.random() defaults to a double between 0.0 and 0.999...
    The text that goes before the class ("Math") is the type, so you would type
    "int" to cast the value as an int, i.e., <code>(int)Math.random();</code>
    Relatedly, you can adjust the range of numbers received by adding 4* to the
    range: for example <code>(int)(4*Math.random());</code> would create a
    range of 0-3.</p>
    <h1>When would you use "=" vs "==" vs ".equals"? Explain what each of these
    does and in which cases you should use them.</h1>
    <p><code>=</code> is the assignment operator. This operator is used to
    assign a value to a variable. For example, <code>double number =
    2.7</code>. Meanwhile, <code>==</code> is a boolean operator, indicating
    that both objects refer to the same memory location. The operator assigns
    equality. The information on either side can be assessed as either true or
    false; for example, <code>20 == 10</code> is false.</p>
    <p><code>.()equals</code></p>
    <p>compares objects in strings. I.e.: <code>Pet myDog = new
    Pet("Terrier")</code></p>
    <p><code>if (myDog.equals(Terrier))</code></p>
    <p><code>println("That's my dog!");</code></p>
