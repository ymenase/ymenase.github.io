				<h1>What is the difference between "switch" and "if/else"? When would you use one versus the other?</h1>
				<p>Switch statement is a way of comparing values. It is indicated by <i>switch() case [value]:</i>. No variables can be declared 
				within a switch statement. By doing this, the computer compares the value of the case compared to the other items in a list.
				Switch is used when you have a finite list of correct answers, like months. 
				If you have an input that's a month you write a switch and each month would be a case. 
				"If/else" is a more commonly used comparison method for more open-ended cases. The "if" statement defines the condition using a Boolean statement and indicates what the program should do if those have been met. 
				If those have not been met exactly, the "else" statement and action will run. "Else" can only be used immediately after an "if statement."
				
				</p>
				<h1>What is "void" in a method declaration? How does this differ from declaring a method with a return type?</h1>
				<p>A method must be called in order to be used -- "void" means no value will be returned, and a statement means a value will be returned.
				<div class="codedemo">The syntax of a method is: public static int methodName(int a, int b) {
				<p>// body</p>
				<p>}</p>
		</div>
		<p>
		<ul>
			<li>public static = modifier</li>
			<li>int = return type</li>
			<li>methodName = name of the method</li>
			<li>a, b = formal parameters</li>
			<li>int a, int b = list of parameters</li>
			</p>
				"Void" means that any type can be declared, such as int, String, boolean, or double. 
				If parameters are declared, it means the program needs that information to produce
				the desired output. Parameters can be passed to a void method. The difference is that a void method can do an operation on something that's in memory.
 				Something with a return value can be passed to another method directly without using a class variable.</p>
				<h1>What happens when you include "import java.util.Scanner;" in your code? Where does this functionality come from? 
				What is the "java" in "java.util.Scanner;"?</h1>
				<p>"import java.util.Scanner" means that we are importing the input library "Scanner". The functionality comes from 
				creating and defining the scanner object, which has been "keyboard" because it is the method by which the human
				is transferring the answer into the computer's digital library. When you instantiate a Scanner 
				you get access to all its methods, which include reading a file or harvesting user input. The import turns into a String. 
				"Java" in the statement "import java.util.Scanner"
				is part of the naming convention and indicates that it is part of Java.</p>
				<h1>What does it mean to "cast a double to an int"? 
				Give an example of when you would do this and explain what is happening.</h1>

				<h1>When would you use "=" vs "==" vs ".equals"? 
				Explain what each of these does and in which cases you should use them.</h1>
