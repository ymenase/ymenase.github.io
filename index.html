            <h1>What is the difference between "switch" and "if/else"? When
            would you use one versus the other?</h1>
            <p>A switch statement is a way of comparing values. It is indicated
            by <em>switch() case [value]:</em>. No variables can be declared
            within a switch statement. By doing this, the computer compares the
            value of the case compared to the other items in a list. Switch is
            used when you have a finite list of correct answers, like months.
            If you have an input that's a month you write a switch and each
            month would be a case. "If/else" is a more commonly used comparison
            method for more open-ended cases. The "if" statement defines the
            condition using a Boolean statement and indicates what the program
            should do if those have been met. If those have not been met
            exactly, the "else" statement and action will run. "Else" can only
            be used immediately after an "if statement."</p>
            <h1>What is "void" in a method declaration? How does this differ
            from declaring a method with a return type?</h1>
            <p>A method must be called in order to be used -- "void" means no
            value will be returned, and a statement means a value will be
            returned. The syntax of a method is:</p>
            <p class="codedemo">public static int methodName(int a, int b)
            {</p>
            <p>// body</p>
            <p>}</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>public static = modifier</li>
        <li>int = return type</li>
        <li>methodName = name of the method</li>
        <li>a, b = formal parameters</li>
        <li>int a, int b = list of parameters</li>
    </ul>
    <p>"Void" means that any type can be declared, such as int, String,
    boolean, or double. If parameters are declared, it means the program needs
    that information to produce the desired output. Parameters can be passed to
    a void method. The difference is that a void method can do an operation on
    something that is in memory. Something with a return value can be passed to
    another method directly without using a class variable.</p>
    <h1>What happens when you include "import java.util.Scanner;" in your code?
    Where does this functionality come from? What is the "java" in
    "java.util.Scanner;"?</h1>
    <p>"import java.util.Scanner" means that we are importing the input library
    "Scanner". The functionality comes from creating and defining the scanner
    object, which has been "keyboard" because it is the method by which the
    human is transferring the answer into the computer's digital library. When
    you instantiate a Scanner you get access to all its methods, which include
    reading a file or harvesting user input. The import turns into a String.
    "Java" in the statement "import java.util.Scanner" is part of the naming
    convention and indicates that it is part of Java.</p>
    <h1>What does it mean to "cast a double to an int"? Give an example of when
    you would do this and explain what is happening.</h1>
    <p>Casting a double to an int means changing the value type from a decimal
    to an integer. Math.random() defaults to a double between 0.0 and 0.999...
    The text that goes before the class ("Math") is the type, so you would type
    "int" to cast the value as an int, i.e., <em>(int)Math.random();</em>
    Relatedly, you can adjust the range of numbers received by adding 4* to the
    range: for example <i>(int)(4*Math.random());</i> would create a range of
    0-3.</p>
    <h1>When would you use "=" vs "==" vs ".equals"? Explain what each of these
    does and in which cases you should use them.</h1>
